            <ul>
                <li>Data Integrity
                    Accurate and Complete Data: All data entered into the system, including fault descriptions,
                    locations, and user information, must be accurate and complete. Data validation checks should be
                    implemented to prevent errors.
                    Data Security: Sensitive user data (e.g., personal information, contact details) must be encrypted
                    and protected from unauthorized access.
                    Data Backup: Regular backups of system data will be performed to prevent data loss in case of system
                    failures or disasters.</li>
                <li>System Integrity
                    Reliability: The system should be designed to be reliable and accessible to users at all times.
                    Redundancy and failover mechanisms can be implemented to ensure uninterrupted service.
                    Security: The system should have robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access,
                    data breaches, and cyberattacks.
                    Performance: The system should be optimized for performance to ensure efficient fault reporting and
                    resolution.</li>
                <li>Compliance
                    Data Protection Regulations: The system must comply with relevant data protection laws (e.g., POPI
                    Act of 2019) to protect user privacy.
                    Accessibility Standards: The system should be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to
                    accessibility standards.
                    Consumer Protection Laws: The system should comply with consumer protection laws, ensuring fair
                    treatment of users and transparent communication.
                    Fairness and Non-Discrimination: The system should be designed to avoid bias and discrimination in
                    fault resolution processes.</li>
                <li>Specific Considerations
                    Transparency: Clear communication channels should be established to keep users informed about fault
                    status and resolution progress.
                    Accountability: The system should track fault reports, assigned technicians, and resolution times to
                    ensure accountability.
                    Efficiency: The system should be designed to streamline fault reporting and resolution processes to
                    minimize inconvenience for users.
                    User Feedback: Mechanisms should be in place to gather user feedback and continuously improve the
                    system.</li>
                <li>Additional Considerations
                    Third-Party Integrations: If the system integrates with other systems (e.g., payment gateways,
                    maintenance management systems), ensure compliance with their terms and conditions.
                    Disaster Recovery: Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to protect system data and ensure
                    business continuity.
                    Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits and security assessments to identify and address potential
                    vulnerabilities.</li>
