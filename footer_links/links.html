                        <br>Data Integrity
                            Accurate and Complete Data: All data entered into the system, including fault descriptions,
                            locations, and user information, must be accurate and complete. Data validation checks should be
                            implemented to prevent errors.
                            Data Security: Sensitive user data (e.g., personal information, contact details) must be encrypted
                            and protected from unauthorized access.
                            Data Backup: Regular backups of system data will be performed to prevent data loss in case of system
                            failures or disasters. <br>
                        <br>System Integrity
                            Reliability: The system should be designed to be reliable and accessible to users at all times.
                            Redundancy and failover mechanisms can be implemented to ensure uninterrupted service.
                            Security: The system should have robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access,
                            data breaches, and cyberattacks.
                            Performance: The system should be optimized for performance to ensure efficient fault reporting and
                            resolution. <br>
                        <br>Compliance
                            Data Protection Regulations: The system must comply with relevant data protection laws (e.g., POPI
                            Act of 2019) to protect user privacy.
                            Accessibility Standards: The system should be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to
                            accessibility standards.
                            Consumer Protection Laws: The system should comply with consumer protection laws, ensuring fair
                            treatment of users and transparent communication.
                            Fairness and Non-Discrimination: The system should be designed to avoid bias and discrimination in
                            fault resolution processes. <br>
                        <br>Specific Considerations
                            Transparency: Clear communication channels should be established to keep users informed about fault
                            status and resolution progress.
                            Accountability: The system should track fault reports, assigned technicians, and resolution times to
                            ensure accountability.
                            Efficiency: The system should be designed to streamline fault reporting and resolution processes to
                            minimize inconvenience for users.
                            User Feedback: Mechanisms should be in place to gather user feedback and continuously improve the
                            system. <br>
                        <br>Additional Considerations
                            Third-Party Integrations: If the system integrates with other systems (e.g., payment gateways,
                            maintenance management systems), ensure compliance with their terms and conditions.
                            Disaster Recovery: Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to protect system data and ensure
                            business continuity.
                            Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits and security assessments to identify and address potential
                            vulnerabilities. <br>
